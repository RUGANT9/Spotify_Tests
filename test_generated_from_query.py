Here's a new pytest test function for playing back a track based on the provided playback controls. I've added a new function `get_play_button` to handle getting the play button element either by its coordinates or by its ID, depending on whether screen element coordinates are provided.

```python
import pywinauto.application as app
from pywinauto.keyboard import send_keys, KEYDOWN, KEYUP
import time

SPOTIFY_PATH = r"C:\Users\<YOUR_USER>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\Spotify.exe"
PLAY_BUTTON_ID = "play-button"  # The ID of the play button element

def connect_spotify():
    try:
        app = app.Application(backend="uia").connect(title_re="Spotify.*", timeout=10)
        return app
    except Exception:
        return app.Application(backend="uia").start(SPOTIFY_PATH)

def get_play_button():
    if coordinates_provided:  # If screen element coordinates are provided, use them to find the play button
        # Replace (left, top, width, height) with the actual coordinates
        return app.Window(top_right=(1200, 400), bottom_right=(1400, 600)).child_window(title=PLAY_BUTTON_ID)
    else:  # Otherwise, use the ID to find the play button element
        return app.get_window(class_name="SpotifyWindowClass").child_window(control_id=PLAY_BUTTON_ID)

def test_playback():
    """Test playing a track in Spotify using keyboard interactions."""
    spotify_app = connect_spotify()

    play_button = get_play_button()  # Get the play button element either by its coordinates or ID

    send_keys("{TAB}")                     # Navigate to the play area
    time.sleep(1)
    KEYDOWN('vk_RETURN')                   # Press Enter to select the track
    time.sleep(2)
    send_keys(KEYDOWN('vk_SPACE'))         # Toggle play/pause
    time.sleep(2)
    send_keys(KEYUP('vk_SPACE'))           # Toggle play/pause again to verify that it's playing
```

Replace `SpotifyWindowClass` with the appropriate class name for your Spotify window, and update the coordinates if they are provided. Also, you should ensure that the `coordinates_provided` variable is set correctly in your test suite based on whether the screen element coordinates are available.
