Here is a new pytest test function for playing a song based on the provided screen element coordinates. I've assumed that the 'search_box' and 'Play_button' are the elements required to interact with the UI, but it might not be the case as you have more specific locators.

```python
def test_play_song_by_coordinates(spotify_app):
    """Search for a song using coordinates and play the first result."""
    search_box = spotify_app.child_window(title="Edit", top=690, left=1, right=1303, bottom=72)
    play_button = spotify_app.child_window(top=511, left=415, right=649, bottom=483)

    search_box.set_focus()
    time.sleep(1)
    # Use send_keys here if the search box doesn't have a SendKeysInput
    search_box.type_keys("Imagine Dragons")
    time.sleep(2)
    play_button.set_focus()
    time.sleep(2)
    play_button.click()
    time.sleep(2)
    # space toggles play / pause
    play_button.click()
```
